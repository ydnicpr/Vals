# 💝 project: better late than never

> **status:** slightly late but full of love (╥﹏╥)
> **target:** my favorite human everrrrr ♡
> **deployment date:** february 14th, 2026 (yes… i know… pls don't be mad)

## 📝 patch notes (aka my apology)

**bug found:** i forgot to ask “will you be my valentine?”.
**reason:** my brain lagged and i kept overthinking abt birthday gift instead....
**hotfix:** i built this tiny website because you deserve more than a dry one-line text.

**to my (rightfully) very cute girlfriend:**

i know i messed up. i know you were sad/mad and you had every right to be.

so i made this instead — something small, just to see you smile even if i’m a little late.
please accept this update to your heart? 🥺👉👈

## ✨ features

- **mobile friendly:** because you’re always on your phone and i wanted it to actually look nice there.
- **emotional damage mode:** try pressing “no” at the end. go ahead. i’ll just cry quietly (｡•́︿•̀｡)
- **custom photos:** yes that’s our picture. because you’re literally the main character.
- **strawberries & cream theme:** soft colors because you’re soft… even when you’re mad at me.

*made with love, panic, and way too much overthinking by your girlfriend ♡*
