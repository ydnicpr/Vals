# 💝 Project: Operation Better Late Than Never (v2.0)

> **Status:** Critical Priority 🚨  
> **Target:** My Favorite Person 🥺  
> **Deployment Date:** February 14th, 2026 (I know, I know...)

## 📝 Patch Notes (The Apology)

**Issue #1:** The boyfriend (me) failed to deploy the "Will You Be My Valentine?" query on time.
**Root Cause:** Latency in brain processing and trying to make this perfect for you.
**Fix:** Deployed this interactive website to make up for it.

**To my angry (but cute) girlfriend:**
I know I'm late, and I know you were mad (rightfully so). I didn't want to just ask you with a boring text. I wanted to build something that shows how much effort I'm willing to put in just to see you smile. 

Please accept this pull request to your heart? 🥺👉👈

## ✨ Features

- **Responsive Design:** Looks great on your phone (mobile-first, just like you're my priority-first).
- **The "Guilt Trip" Engine:** Try clicking "No" on the last page. Go ahead. See what happens. (Spoiler: It rains, and I cry).
- **Custom Assets:** Features a photo of us (`us.jpg`) because you are the main character.
- **Strawberries & Cream UI:** A custom color palette designed just for you.

## 🚀 How to Run

1.  Open `index.html` in your browser (Chrome/Safari).
2.  Turn up your volume (there is music!).
3.  Answer the questions honestly (but please say yes eventually).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5:** For the structure of my love.
- **CSS3:** For the style (because you have the best style).
- **JavaScript:** For the logic (since I clearly lacked some earlier).
